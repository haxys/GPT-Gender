# The Gender Calculator

**DISCLAIMER: This is not intended to be used as a scientific tool. It is just for fun. Any sudden self-discoveries should be explored with a trained professional.**

I asked ChatGPT to describe the common qualities and traits associated with masculinity and femininity in the United States. I then asked it to score those traits based on how masculine or feminine they are. I then used this data to create a very simple, very unscientific survey, which you can use to calculate your very own gender score!

Unfortunately, it's based on societal views, which fall along a Male/Female spectrum. This fails to account for non-binary, genderqueer, and other identities. Further research should be conducted to create a more inclusive version of this calculator.
